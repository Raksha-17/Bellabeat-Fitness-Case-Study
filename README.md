This dataset has been originally generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk and contains personal fitnesss tracker of thirty (30) eligible fitbit users. The dataset used for the purpose of this analysis is available on Kaggle [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) [accessed on 10/01//23]  

### Scenario

I will be working in the capacity of a junior data analyst at marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Ask
### Business Task
The key business task of this analysis is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use the non-Bellabeat smart devices which would subsequently, help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy. 

### Analysis Questions:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Prepare
### Data Source
The prepare step generally provides adequate information on data source.

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on Kaggle [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), and is stored in eighteen(18) csv. files which consists of daily activities such as; steps, calories, heartrate, sleep, etc.
The data, which contains personal tracker was submitted and consented to by 30 eligible fitbit users.
Most of the csv. files are stored in long format while some are stored in narrow format.
To test the integrity of the data; the dataset is expected to be **ROCCC** which stands for **Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current , Cited** respectively.

**Reliable**- the reliability of the dataset can be contested as there are some limitations. For instance, the sample size,(personal tracker details of only 30 users was provided) which may lead to sampling bias. Similarly, the gender of the 30 users is completely unknown and it is a fact that Bellabeat as a wellness company is majorly focused on the wellness and fitness of women.

**Original**- the dataset cannot be said to be original as it was provided by a third party(Amazon Mechanical Turk

**Comprehensive**- the dataset can be said to be comprehensive enough as the whole of the 18 csv files contains adequate information about the users’ activity ranging from heartrate, sleeptime, intensities, calories burnt, weight etc.

**Current**- For a dataset that was collected and last updated since 2016, and is being used for an analysis in 2022, the dataset cannot be said to be current.

**Cited**- the dataset has been properly cited as a third party data and is available in the public domain.

### Data Organization

 The dailyActivity_merged , weightLoginfo_merged and sleepDay_merged csv files have been selected to carry out this analysis as the former contains all tracker details of users on a daily basis. All 3 files were migrated into one workbook but different sheets and saved as an excel workbook.
 
 ## Process
 The process of data cleaning, transformation and visualization will be carried out in GoogleSheets and Pivot table and Charts.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**

An overview of the weight_loginfo dataset

I converted the workbooks from csv files into Google Sheets workbooks in order not to lose part data while working in csv file.

The date column of the Weight_Loginfo comprises of both date and time, so I used the power query to split column by the space delimiter, used the Text to columns function under the data tab to format the date into “ddmmyyyy” format and created named ranges for the column headers. I then used the TEXT function to extract the Days and Month in the date -

=TEXT(D2,"ddd") , =TEXT(D2,"mmm")

An overview of the sleepDay_merged after transformation


All these being done, I now have my dataset in one worksheet where I continued my data transformation by ;

*converting the dataset into tables

*creating named ranges with the top row (column headers)

*using the formula =UNIQUE(B2:B1000) to ascertain how many users are contained in the dataset. Here, we found out that there are 33 unique IDs as opposed to the 30 users expected.

*with this formula =UNIQUE(D2:D1000) I was able to know that only 8 users logged their weight details, which means we will be working with weightinfo for 8 people as against the 33 unique users.

*using formula =SUM(O2+P2+Q2+R2) to create a new column named Total_minutes.

*formatting the date columns into dd-mm-yyyy format using the date option in Text to columns too , then used the function =TEXT([C2,”dddd”) to extract the day from the date.

*using the formula =CONVERT(H12,"mn","hr") to convert minutes TotalMinutesAsleep to TotalHoursAsleep and lastly,

*formatting the numbered columns into two(2) decimal places. Below is a view of all columns in the dataset after cleaning and transformation;
